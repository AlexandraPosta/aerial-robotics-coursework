# Aerial Robotics Coursework
Supporting scripts to estimate the performance of a heavy weight drone capable of performing fire fighting. Part of a University module.

Files:
- arm_weight_calculator: try to estimate the maximum weight of an external arm attachment
- kinematics_calculator: derive mathematical models approximations of the drone components and check performance
